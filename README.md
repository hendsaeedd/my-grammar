### Project Description

This project consists of a grammar for a programming language, created using Gold Parser Builder, and a Windows Form application that allows users to write and execute programs written in this language. The grammar defines the syntax of the language and is used to parse user input and generate an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST is then used to generate executable code, which is run using the .NET framework.
